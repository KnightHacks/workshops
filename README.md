## About
This repository groups workshops by academic year and series to make it easy to find materials for classes, events, and self-study. Each workshop typically includes source code, a README, and presentation files when available.

## Repository Structure
Top-level layout (examples):

```bash
workshops/
└── 2024-2025/
    └── class-related/
        └── cs1-finals-review/
            ├── heap/
            │   ├── heap.c
            │   ├── heap.h
            │   └── main.c
            ├── sorting/
            │   ├── bubbleSort.c
            │   └── mergeSort.c
            └── README.md
```

Each workshop folder may contain:
- `code` files (source code for examples and exercises)
- `presentation` files (slides, PDFs)
- `README.md` with workshop-specific notes and instructions

## How to Use
- Browse by year and series to find the workshop you need.
- Open the workshop's `README.md` for setup instructions and sample runs.
- Many folders include runnable examples and `input.txt` fixtures for quick testing.
