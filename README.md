# Knight Hacks Workshops
Welcome to the Knight Hacks Workshops Repository! In this repository, you can find code snippets and presentations for all of our various workshops. In an attempt to make this repo accessible, all of our workshops will be organized in the following file structure, where (school-year), (series), and (workshop-name) represent placeholder values.

```bash
Knighthacks/workshops/
└── (school-year)/
    └── (series)/
        └── (workshop-name)/
            ├── code.xyz
            ├── presentation.pptx
            └── README.md
```
