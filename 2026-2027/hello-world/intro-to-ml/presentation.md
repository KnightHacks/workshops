# Introduction to Machine Learning — Presentation Outline

### Audience: 
Beginners with basic programming (Python) and high-school level math (algebra, basic probability).
Duration: 60–90 minutes (adjustable)

### Purpose
- Provide instructors with a structured guide to teach an Intro to ML session without embedding slides.
- Focus on core concepts, motivating examples, interactive demos, and next steps for learners.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what Machine Learning (ML) is and how it differs from classical programming.
- Distinguish supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning at a high level.
- Grasp key ML workflow steps: data, features, model, training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Be able to implement and evaluate a simple supervised model (e.g., linear regression or logistic regression) conceptually and via a short demo.
- Know common pitfalls (overfitting, data leakage) and basic mitigation strategies (train/test split, cross-validation, regularization)


### Workshop Summary
- Target audience: beginners curious about practical ML workflows and neural networks; assumes comfort with Python and basic math.
- Goal: give learners an intuitive understanding of supervised learning and a hands-on comparison of a dense (fully-connected) neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the MNIST digit dataset.
- Outcomes: attendees will run the demo notebook, see differences in model capacity and inductive bias, and learn when CNNs outperform DNNs on image tasks.

### Demo: MNIST — DNN vs CNN
- Purpose: demonstrate how model architecture affects performance on image data by training two models on the same MNIST dataset and comparing metrics, training curves, and qualitative predictions.
