# CS for Career

How computer science skills open doors across industries

## Overview

This document introduces how computer science (CS) can enhance career paths for both CS and non-CS students. It outlines common CS subfields, what employers value, real-life case studies from recent interns and professionals, and practical next steps for students who want to get started.

## Why CS Matters

Computer science provides a versatile toolkit: building automation, analyzing data, creating digital products, and scaling systems. Employers across industries value technical literacy, problem solving, and the ability to apply computational thinking to domain problems.

## Common CS Subfields

- Frontend — building user interfaces and client-side web or mobile experiences.
- Backend — servers, APIs, databases, and the infrastructure that powers applications.
- Machine Learning (ML) — data modeling, training pipelines, and model deployment.
- DevOps / SRE — continuous integration/deployment, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring.
- UI/UX — design systems, user research, and interaction design.
