# Java Spring Boot Workshop

Welcome to the **Java Spring Boot Workshop**! In this hands-on workshop, we will build a backend for a simple web app - 'Click Challenge' using Spring Boot, one of the most popular frameworks for building Java-based backend services. The goal is to give you a introduction of getting started with Spring Boot development and to spike interest towards Spring boot.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, here are some prerequisites:

- **Java** At least some understanding is a plus
- **IDE** This workshop uses VS Code
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the project)
- **Postman or any API testing tool** (optional, for testing the REST API)

## Environment Setup

1. Install Java Extension Pack by Microsoft in VS Code.
2. Install JDK (Java Development Kit).
   - There will be a pop-up in VS Code after installing Java Extension Pack to install JDK if you don't have one.
     - Even if the popup doesn't show up, go to google and search download JDK for your system.
   - Select Version 17 or 21 if available. Those are the LTS (Long Time Support) versions.
   - Remember the path where you are installing the JDK (just in case).
   - Reload VS Code after installation.
   - Test installation by opening the VS Code terminal and typing `java --version`
     - If it gives an error, google how to configure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable on your system.
3. Install Spring Boot Extension Pack by VMware in VS Code.
4. (optional) Install the API testing app Postman

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we will:

1. Set up a Spring Boot project.
2. Build a simple RESTful API.
3. Add basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage a resource (e.g., `Employee`).
4. Test the API using Postman.
5. Discuss key concepts of Spring Boot.
