## Core Angular Concepts

### Components
The building blocks of Angular applications. Components encapsulate HTML, CSS, and logic.

### Data Binding
Angular’s powerful data binding synchronizes the model and the view automatically.

### Services
Services allow you to share data and logic across components. They are a key part of Angular’s dependency injection system.
