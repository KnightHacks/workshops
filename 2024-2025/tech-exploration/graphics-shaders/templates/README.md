## Templates

This Folder contains templates for setting up OpenGL with GLFW and GLAD

### What is GLFW

A library that gives us functions that let's us easily work with OpenGL

### What is GLAD

GLAD loads all the functions that aren't specfied at runtime in OpenGL. It saves us time from having to intialize all these functions manually.
