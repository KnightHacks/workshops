## Own Your IDE
An intro to VSCode, code execution, and IDE extensibility

---

## Topics and Agenda
- IDEs
- VSCode Settings
- Workspaces
- Key bindings
- Extension Ecosystem
- Code Execution
- Terminal Configuration (WSL)
- Theming

---

## What is an IDE?

---

- "Integrated Development Environment"
- Where your code is written
- Development tools such as building, testing, and packing, along with writing

---

## Examples of IDEs
- IntelliJ
- NetBeans
- PyCharm
- Eclipse
- WebStorm

---

## Why VSCode?
- Open Source, and extremely extensible
- Extensive community and documentation
- Used in a lot of classes / by peers

---

## Isn't VSCode a Text Editor?
- Yes, but I don't care and with enough time we can make it an IDE.
- Been getting closer over time

---

## Installing VSCode
- Follow the documentation
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download

---

---

## Workspaces
- A sub-environment within VSCode for certain projects
- Great for saving file configurations / organization
- Allows for workspace specific configurations and extensions 

---
## Extensions
- Since VSCode is Open Source, it is rather easy to learn how to plug into the editor and extend it
- Home to a vast ecosystem of VSCode Extensions

---

- Settings Sync
- Language Support
- Live Server
- Prettier
- GitLens
- Live Share
- Indent Rainbow
- Code Spell Checker
- Turbo Console Log
- Code Diagram

---

## Settings Sync
Allows you to sync settings and extensions across VSCode instances using GitHub

---

## Language Support Extensions
Provides rich text completions for programming languages.

---

## Live Server
Adds live reload refreshing to HTML / CSS projects

---

## Prettier
Provides auto formatting for JavaScript, JSX, Angular, Vue, Flow, Typescript, CSS, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and YAML

---

## GitLens
Manage source control and visualize source changes for rich commit context.

---

## Live Share
Great way for multiple people to write code in parallel

---

## Indent Rainbow
More cosmetic, but is a lifesaver with heavily indented code

---

## Code Spell Checker
To catch bad typos in plain English, like in website text blobs

---

## Turbo Console Log
Who needs a debugger? Use TCL instead.

---

## Code Diagram
Very useful for projects and DSA assignments!

---

## Code Execution (relating to class)
- C Support
- Java Support

---

## Terminals
- Linux (Bash)
- Mac (ZSH)
- Windows (Powershell -> WSL)

---

## Set default terminal
```
Terminal: Select Default Profile
```

---

## Running Code
### Interpreted Code vs Compiled Code

---

## Interpreted Code
- Simply run the command to begin execution.
- Examples include **Python**, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, PHP

---

```
python3 test_file.py
```

---

## Compiled Code
- First requires a compilation step to convert to machine code
- Then you can run the resulting exe or binary
- Examples include **JAVA** and **C**

---

```
gcc main.c -o main.out

./main.out
```

---

```
javac main.java

java main
```
