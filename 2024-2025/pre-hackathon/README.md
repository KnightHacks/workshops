# Pre-Hackathon Workshop Series
At the start of Fall semester before hackathon season, we will present technologies with fast and smooth development experience specifically tailored towards the 36 hour time crunch of a hackathon. This series is our shortest, only lasting the first few weeks of Fall before hackathon season begins, which is September 14th this year with Hackabull!
