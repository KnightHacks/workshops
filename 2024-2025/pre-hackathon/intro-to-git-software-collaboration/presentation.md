### What is git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks files within a folder (Repository). It's goals include speed, data integrity, and distributed non-linear workflows enabling thousands of branches that run on different computers 

---
### Who even uses git?
In the annual Stack Overflow developer survey, 93.9% of responses said that git was their main version control platform
---

### History

Made by Linus Torvalds (Linux guy) after the BitKeeper License was revoked for Linux

1.0 Release on December 21st, 2005 

"The information manager from hell" - git source code

---
### Design
- Non-Linear development
- Distributed Development 
- Efficient, Large Projects

### Git Servers
Have a repo, now what?
- GitWeb, Github, Gitlab
---
### Why Notion? 
---
### Methodologies
---
### How we use these tools at KnightHacks
---
### Hackathon Prep
---
### Basic git commands 
- git init: Initialize a new repository.
- git clone: Copy an existing repository.
- git add: Stage changes.
- git commit: Record changes.
- git push: Send changes to remote.
- git pull: Retrieve and merge changes from remote.
- git status: View current repo status.
- git log: Review commit history.
---
### Branches
- Create, switch, and delete branches.
- Work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously.

---
### Pull requests
- Propose, discuss, and review changes before merging.
- Useful for team collaboration and quality checks.

---
### Issues
- Used to track bugs, features, and tasks.
- Can be assigned, prioritized, and linked to pull requests.
---
### Merging...
- Requires resolving conflicts if changes overlap
- Integrate changes from one branch into another
---

### Tasks
- Organize workflow with tasks or issues.
- Use GitHub project boards or task lists to track progress
- Make sure your team knows what you are doing
---
### 0 -> 1 Phase
- Moving from the idea stage to working on an actual project
- Includes setup, initial coding, and research
---
### git != github
- Git: Version control system for managing source code
- GitHub: Cloud platform that hosts Git repositories and offers collaboration tools.
---
### best practices
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch.
- Work on separate branches for features or bug fixes.
- TALK WITH TEAM

---
### forking, OSS & Contributions
- Forking allows you to create a personal copy of a project.
- Contribute to open-source projects by submitting pull requests.
